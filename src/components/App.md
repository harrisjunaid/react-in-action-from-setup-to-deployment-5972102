This line shows how you’re **using the `ListCast` component** and passing it a **callback function** via the `onChoice` prop. Let’s unpack it step by step:

---

### 1. `<ListCast ... />`
- This is a custom React component you’ve defined elsewhere (the one that fetches and displays cast members).
- You’re rendering it inside another component.

---

### 2. `onChoice={(info) => { setMemberInfo(info) }}`
- Here you’re passing a **prop** called `onChoice` to `ListCast`.
- The value of `onChoice` is an **inline arrow function**:  
  ```js
  (info) => { setMemberInfo(info) }
  ```
- This function takes one argument (`info`) and calls `setMemberInfo(info)`.

---

### 3. What this means in practice
- Inside `ListCast`, you can call `props.onChoice(someData)` whenever a user selects or clicks on a cast member.
- When that happens, the parent component (the one rendering `<ListCast />`) will run `setMemberInfo(info)`.
- `setMemberInfo` is almost certainly a state setter from `useState`, so this updates the parent’s state with the chosen cast member’s info.

---

### 4. Example flow
1. Parent renders:
   ```jsx
   const [memberInfo, setMemberInfo] = useState(null);

   return <ListCast onChoice={(info) => { setMemberInfo(info) }} />;
   ```
2. User clicks a cast member inside `ListCast`.
3. `ListCast` calls `props.onChoice(member)` with that member’s data.
4. Parent’s `setMemberInfo(member)` runs, updating `memberInfo`.
5. Parent re-renders with the new `memberInfo` available.

---

✅ **In short:**  
This is a **parent-to-child communication pattern** where the parent gives the child (`ListCast`) a callback. The child calls it when something happens (like a user choice), and the parent updates its own state accordingly.

---

Would you like me to also show you how to **wire up `ListCast` so it actually calls `onChoice` when a member is clicked**, turning this into a working parent–child interaction?
